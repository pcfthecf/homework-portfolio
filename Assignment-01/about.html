		<p id="block">Hi! I'm Portia, a Brand Designer with experience working with architects, interior designers and product designers to build their business identities in print, place and on the web. Working in collaboration with skilled consultants, I assist creative professionals in developing who they are by establishing their comprehensive brand identities whether it's the launch of a new website, designing and manufacturing new product packaging or even helping them create a new brand environment through signage and one-of-a-kind displays for trade and trunk shows.</p>
