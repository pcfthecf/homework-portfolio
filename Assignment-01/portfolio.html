				<h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>

					<p>I have over 10 years experience working within the design community and throughout the architecture and development industries. As a Brand Designer, I've learned how to best communicate a company's identity across various media types and through strategic communications. Currently, I am completing the Front-end Web Development course at General Assembly, so I can expand my website development portfolio and work more closely with back-end developers to better serve my clients. In addition to web design and development, I'm hoping to build a new portfolio app for designers of all mediums to use on the go.</p>
